      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p> I'm a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. My research interests lie in the intersection of causal inference and simulation. I'm fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://groups.cs.umass.edu/jensen/">David Jensen</a> and <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~phaas/">Peter Haas</a>. I have also worked on research involving disease modeling and risk assessment for communities in Massachusetts.
      </p>

      <p>Prior to this, I worked at Cisco Systems (India) as a systems engineer. I was responsible for solution design and testing for routing, switching, wireless, and data center architectures. I also contributed to developing network programmability solutions for various technology. I have an undergraduate degree in electronics and telecommunication engineering.  
      </p>

      <h2>Research</h2>
      <p> My research lies in the intersection of causal inference and simulation. My goal is to build explainable simulation metamodels using causal inference. I also work on improving evaluation of causal algorithms by developing new types of data that result in a more comprehensive and fair evaluation of estimators. 
      </p>
